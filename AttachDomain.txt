2. Attaching a Domain Name to Your Hosting

To attach a domain name to your Node.js website hosted on Hostinger, you will need to update your DNS settings and configure your server to handle requests to your domain.

Step-by-Step Guide:

Purchase a Domain Name:
If you haven’t done this yet, you can buy a domain name from Hostinger (they have an integrated domain registration service), or any other domain provider like GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.

Configure DNS Records:

Once you have your domain, you need to set up DNS records that point to your server’s IP address.

Log in to your Hostinger account (or the domain provider where you purchased the domain).

Find the DNS settings (it might be labeled as "DNS Management" or "Manage DNS").

Set the A record:

Create or edit an A record for your domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com or yourdomain.com).

Set the value of the A record to the public IP address of your server (you can find this in the Hostinger control panel or ask Hostinger support).

Example:

Host: @ (for the root domain)

Type: A

Value: 123.45.67.89 (replace with your actual server IP)

Set Up Your Web Server:

Now that your domain points to your server, you'll need to set up a reverse proxy or a web server like Nginx or Apache to forward incoming traffic to your Node.js application.

Here’s how to set up Nginx as a reverse proxy:

Install Nginx (if not already installed):
